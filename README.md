# Survivor_Game With Qt
Also a Mid-Term project
Thanks the excellent videos in bilibili, I watch them and start to use QtCreater.
I remember when I finally make my picture on the screen, the joy and suprise is even much stronger than I learn to code a "Hello world".
And I learn a thing: If you didn't have the confidence on something, just do it early.
An unforgettbale journey.

# Survivor_Game With Qt
Also a Mid-Term project.
Thanks the excellent videos in BiliBili, I watch them and start to use QtCreater.
I remember when I finally make my first picture on the screen, the joy and suprise is even much stronger than I learn to code a "Hello world".
And I learn a thing: Always overcome your fear before you tackle with something terrible.
An unforgettbale journey.
